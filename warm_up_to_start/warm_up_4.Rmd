#This effect means that overall when we ignore how much alcohol had been drunk the type of face being rated significantly affected attractiveness ratings. 
#The main effect of alcohol is significant:
#This effect means that when we ignore whether the participant rated unattractive or attractive faces the amount of alcohol significantly influenced their attractiveness ratings. 
#The fact that the interaction effect was significant suggests that the effect of the type of face depended on how much alcohol was consumed and vice versa.
#The effect of alcohol on attractiveness ratings was different when rating unattractive faces compared to when rating attractive faces. 
#The difference between the mean ratings of attractive and unattractive faces varied as a function of how much alcohol was consumed.
